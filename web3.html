    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" target="_blank"><u>periodic table</u></a> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:
    </p>

    <p>
        <var>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O</var>
    </p>

    <p>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H<sub>2</sub></var>) and oxygen gas (<var>O<sub>2</sub></var>) to form water (<var>H<sub>2</sub>O</var>).
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
        <i>Stoichiometry</i> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Subscripts</i> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <i>superscripts</i> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="conclusion">
        Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
